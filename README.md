- [CausalSim](https://github.com/CausalSim/Unbiased-Trace-Driven-Simulation): CausalSim
  is a causal framework for unbiased trace-driven simulation. Current
  trace-driven simulators assume that the interventions being simulated (e.g., a

  real-world traces are often biased by the choices algorithms make during trace
  collection, and hence replaying traces under an intervention may lead to
  incorrect results. CausalSim addresses this challenge by learning a causal
  model of the system dynamics and latent factors capturing the underlying
  system conditions during trace collection. It learns these models using an
  initial randomized control trial (RCT) under a fixed set of algorithms, and
  then applies them to remove biases from trace data when simulating new
